## The Second Odin on Rails JS [Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project)
This project is meant to demonstrate basic JS knowledge of how to create and interact with simple, dynamic DOM elements.

### Reflections
I took a significantly long time to debug an issue which was essentially an issue of JavaScript not handle type coercion as I expected. I was originally returning the prompt for the grid length as a string, under the assumption that JS would coerce this into a number before attempting to add to another number; it turns out that actually, JS will see the string type first and try to coerce the number into a string instead -- the exact opposite of what I wanted! I only realized this about an hour in, and was probably the biggest hiccup I had during development of this implementation. Otherwise, the project felt similar to the first in that I was able to treat most things as I would in other languages I know; I found interacting with the DOM to be tedious, since I had to look up documentation when I wanted to access a node property or function (for whatever reasons, VSCode wasn't cooperating and showing me on its own sometimes).
